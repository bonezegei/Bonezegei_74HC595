# Bonezegei_74HC595
The Bonezegei_74HC595 is a simple library that makes it easy to use the 74HC595 chip. This chip helps your main computer (like an Arduino) get more output pins, letting it control many things like more LEDs or lights using only a few wires. The library takes care of the complex steps of sending data quickly, so you only need simple commands to tell the chip to turn the lights on or off. This saves you time and makes it much easier to build projects with many outputs.
